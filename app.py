    """
    Perform various operations on two lists based on the provided operations string.

    Args:
    - list1 (List[int]): The first list of integers.
    - list2 (List[int]): The second list of integers.
    - operations (str): A string containing a sequence of characters representing operations to be performed.
                        Each character represents an operation:
                        'M' - Merge the lists.
                        'R' - Remove duplicates.
                        'S' - Sort the list.
                        'V' - Sort the list in descending order.

    Returns:
    - List[int]: The result list after performing the specified operations.
